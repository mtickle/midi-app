# MIDI-APP

MIDI App is a small tool I wrote to understand how MIDI commands are issued from MIDI controllers and how they can be processed in JavaScript. 

I also added a function to show the names of chords that are played from the MIDI device.

You can see the commands in the "MIDI Messages" panel. Only keys are supported at this time. You can see incoming commands from pads, knobs and pitch bends, but they have no functionality here.
